**iterator**: iterators are used by users to query keys in a range in sorted order. See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Basic-Operations#iteration

**point lookup** and **range lookup**: In RocksDB, point lookup means Get() and range lookup means reading data using a iterator.

**SST File** or **data file**: SST stands for Sorted Sequence Table. They are persistent files storing data. In the file keys are usually organized in sorted order so that a key or iterating position can be identifies through a binary search.

**LSM-tree**: See the definition in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree RocksDB is LSM-tree-based storage engine.

**Write-Ahead-Log (WAL)** or **log**: A log file used to recover data that is not yet flushed to SST files, during DB recovery. See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Write-Ahead-Log-File-Format

**mem table** / **write buffer**: the in-memory data structure that stores the most recent updates of the database. Usually it is organized in sorted order and includes a binary searchable index. See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Basic-Operations#memtable-and-table-factories

**mem table switch**: During this process, the current **active memtable** (the one current writes go to) is closed and turned into an **immutable memtable**. At the same time, we will close the current WAL file and start a new one. 

**sequence number (SeqNum)**: each write to the database will be assigned an auto-incremented ID number. The number is attached with the key-value pair in WAL file, memtable, and SST files. The sequence number is used to implement snapshot read, garbage collection in compactions, MVCC in transactions, and some other purposes.

**recovery**: the process of restarting a database after it failed or was closed.

**flush**: background jobs that write out data in mem tables into SST files.

**compaction**: background jobs that merge some SST files into some other SST files. LevelDB's compaction also includes flush. In RocksDB, we further distinguished the two. See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/RocksDB-Basics#multi-threaded-compactions

**Leveled Compaction** or **Level-Based Compaction Style**: the default compaction style of RocksDB. 

**Universal Compaction Style**: an alternative compaction algorithm. See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Universal-Compaction

**Comparator**: A plug-in class which can define the order of keys. See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/include/rocksdb/comparator.h

**Column Family**: column family is a separate key space in one DB. In spite of the misleading name, it has nothing to do with the “column family” concept in other storage systems. RocksDB doesn't even have the concept of “column”. See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Column-Families

**snapshot**: a snapshot is a logical consistent point-in-time view, in a running DB. See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/RocksDB-Basics#gets-iterators-and-snapshots

**checkpoint**: A checkpoint is a physical mirror of the database in another directory in the file system. See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Checkpoints

**backup**: RocksDB has a backup tool to help users backup the DB state to a different location, like HDFS. See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/How-to-backup-RocksDB%3F

“**Version**”: An internal concept of RocksDB. A version consists of all the live SST files in one point of the time. Once a flush or compaction finishes, a new “version” will be created because the list of live SST files has changed. An old “version” can continue being used by on-going read requests or compaction jobs. Old versions will eventually be garbage collected.

“**Super Version**”: An internal concept of RocksDB. A version consists the list SST files (a “version”) and the list of live mem tables in one point of the time. Either a compaction or flush, or a mem table switch will cause a new “super version” to be created. An old “super version” can continue being used by on-going read requests. Old super versions will eventually be garbage collected after it is not needed anymore.

**block cache**: in-memory data structure that cache the hot data blocks from the SST files. See See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Block-Cache

**Statistics**: an in-memory data structure that contains cumulative stats of live databases. https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Statistics

**perf context**: an in-memory data structure to measure thread-local stats. It is usually used to measure per-query stats. See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Perf-Context-and-IO-Stats-Context

**DB properties**: some running status can be returned by the function DB::GetProperty().

**Table Properties**: metadata stored in each SST file. It includes system properties that are generated by RocksDB and user defined table properties calculated by user defined call-backs. See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/include/rocksdb/table_properties.h

**write stall**: When flush or compaction is backlogged, RocksDB may actively slowdown writes to make sure flush and compaction can catch up. See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Write-Stalls 

**bloom filter**: See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/RocksDB-Bloom-Filter

**prefix bloom filter**: a special bloom filter that can be limitly used in iterators. Some file reads are avoided if an SST file or memtable doesn't contain the prefix of the lookup key extracted by the prefix extractor. See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Prefix-Seek-API-Changes

**prefix extractor**: a callback class that can extract prefix part of a key. This is most frequently used as the prefix used in prefix bloom filter. See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/include/rocksdb/slice_transform.h

**block-based bloom filter** or **full bloom filter**: Two different approaches of storing bloom filters in SST files. see https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/RocksDB-Bloom-Filter#new-bloom-filter-format

**compaction filter**: a user plug-in that can modify or drop existing keys during a compaction. See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/include/rocksdb/compaction_filter.h

**merge operator**: RocksDB supports a special operator Merge(), which is a delta record, merge operand, to the existing value. Merge operator is a user defined call-back class which can merge the merge operands.  See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Merge-Operator-Implementation

**Block-Based Table**: The default SST file format. See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Rocksdb-BlockBasedTable-Format

**Block**: data block of SST files. In SST files, a block is stored in a compressed form.

**PlainTable**: An alternative format of SST file format, optimized for ramfs. See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/PlainTable-Format

**forward iterator / tailing iterator**: A special iterator option that optimizes for very specific use cases. See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Tailing-Iterator

**single delete**: a special delete operation which only works when users never update an existing key: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Single-Delete
